Result:
Thus, the program to insert elements in queue using array is verified successfully.



 
EXP NO:15 C FUNCTION TO DELETE ELEMENTS IN QUEUE USING ARRAY



Aim:

To create a function in C that deletes an element from a queue implemented using an array.

Algorithm:

1.	Check if the Queue is Empty
o	If the front pointer is -1, it means the queue is empty, and there are no elements to delete. Print a message indicating that the queue is empty.
2.	Delete the Front Element
o	If the queue is not empty, the element at the front index is deleted.
o	Increment the front pointer by 1 to remove the element and point to the next element in the queue.
3.	Check if the Queue Becomes Empty After Deletion:
o	After deletion, check if the front pointer has passed the rear pointer (front > rear). If this is true, reset both front and rear to -1, indicating that the queue is now empty.
4.	End the Function.
